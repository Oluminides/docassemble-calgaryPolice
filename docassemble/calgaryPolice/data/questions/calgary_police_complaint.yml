      **Next steps**:
      
      [NOINDENT] This complaint is made on the basis that the police officer(s) engaged in police misconduct as defined by section 5(1) of the *Alberta Police Regulations*. As per the *Alberta Police Act*, this complaint is being forwarded to the Calgary Police Service, Chief of the Calgary Police Service, Calgary Police Commission, and Minister of Justice and Solicitor General.    
     
     
     [NOINDENT] I request that this complaint is subject to an evidence-based investigation, to ensure the reputation of the Calgary Police Service is not discredited. The *Alberta Police Regulations* govern the discipline and performance of police officers. To be a police officer, under section 36 of the *Alberta Police Act*, the person must, with respect to the carrying out of the duties of a police officer, meet those basic standards of skill and knowledge that are acceptable to the Minister of Justice and Solicitor General. The complaint submitted today concerns the basic standards of skill and knowledge that the officer(s) thought were acceptable. I believe the actions of the officer(s) were misconduct, as defined by law and the Minister of Justice.
     
     
     [NOINDENT] If the complaint leads to an investigation, once the investigation is completed, the Chief of the Calgary Police Service will determine whether or not there is sufficient evidence, based on a balance of probabilities, to prove misconduct. If misconduct is proven, the Chief directs what form of discipline, if any, is to take place. This discipline may range from a warning to full dismissal without pay.
     
     
     
      [NOINDENT] If dissatisfied with the Chief of Police or the Commission’s resolution of a complaint, an individual also has the right to appeal that decision to the Law Enforcement and Review Board. This Board is an independent non-police body consisting of a chairperson and two members appointed by the provincial government. This appeal can relate to the final disposition of a complaint following a formal investigation or hearing, or a summary dismissal of a complaint. To appeal a decision, an individual has to file with a written notice explaining the grounds of your appeal within 30 days of being advised of the decision. The Review Board will advise, in writing, of the date, time and place of the hearing and what, if anything, will be required. An individual appealing a decision also has the right to counsel if chosen.
