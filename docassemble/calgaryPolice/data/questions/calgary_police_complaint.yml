# ==================== Intro =================== #
question: |
  This is the City of Calgary’s complaint tool for the Calgary Police Service. This tool is to help increase access to justice, so anyone can file a police complaint.
subquestion: |
  If something happened involving the **Calgary Police Service** that you believe was not right, you can complain about that. **If you want to complain, you are in the right place.** 
  
  This tool is **designed to assist you** in making your complaint in a way that is **straightforward, convenient, and free of charge.**

  ###How this online tool works
  STEP 1.	**Questions:** You will be asked questions to help you **organize the full story** of what happened. **This should take 15-35 minutes.**
  
    [INDENTBY 0.6in]Some questions will be open ended, some will just be checking off boxes if true.
  
  STEP 2. **Complaint Letter:** This online tool will then **automatically generate a complaint letter** for you to review.  
  
    [INDENTBY 0.6in]It will **look professionally written and will specifically mention any laws or regulations** the police may have breached based on what your answers were during the questions.
  
  STEP 3.	**Submitting Complaint:** You can then **officially file your police complaint with one click**, or **save the letter** to your computer if you don’t want to submit the police complaint.
  
   1.  You can file a complaint anonymously or with your personal information. Note that **if you file a complaint anonymously it is not likely to lead to an investigation.**
   2.  The letter will get sent to **5 different parties:** Calgary Police Professional Standards Branch, Calgary Police Commission, Chief of Calgary Police, Alberta Minister of Justice, and Alberta Provincial Complaints Director. 
   3.  You can also choose to not submit the letter, and **instead save and print the letter** and then **take the letter to a lawyer for legal advice** as well, if you want legal advice on your complaint before officially submitting it. 
  
  STEP 4.	**Complaint is Reviewed:** A human investigator will then go through your complaint, since this is just an online tool to help and not a final decision, and will determine the validity of your complaint. This may lead to an investigation, but it may also lead to closing the complaint.
  
    [INDENTBY 0.6in]If you complete this complaint process and your complaint is received, but an investigator deems you ineligible to complain, your complaint will not be investigated. If this happens, it is open to you to seek legal advice from a lawyer about the investigator’s opinion.
  
  
  ###This service is not the only way you can complain. 
  
  There are **4 ways you can complain about Calgary Police:**
  
  1.  **Online** using this complaint tool
  2.	**Over the phone** by calling the Calgary Police Service at 403-428-5904
  3.	**In person** by calling the Calgary Police Service at 403-428-5904 and booking an appointment 
  4.	**By mailing a letter** to the Calgary Police Service
  
  ###Your security and privacy is very important to us
  
  We use banking level encryption and no information will be collected aside from what you choose to include in your complaint. 
  
  [INDENTBY 0.6in]Our tool also does not save any information you enter, and after 90 minutes will delete any information you inputted if your window is still open. Once you submit a complaint, it gets sent to the different parties and then automatically deletes from our online tool system. For more information, **[click here](https://docassemble.org/docs/security.html)**.

# ==================== Important Info =================== #
question: |
  Important notes before you start.
subquestion: |
  ###This is **legal information**, not legal advice.

  [INDENTBY 0.6in]For more information on the difference, **{click here}**.
  
  ###Filing a complaint against the police does not lead to financial compensation
  
  [INDENTBY 0.6in]The primary goal of filing a complaint against police is accountability, and that **there is no financial compensation available through the complaint process.**
  
  ###There are time limits for filing police complaints
  
  [INDENTBY 0.6in]A complaint must be made within **1 year of the date of the police misconduct**, or within **1 year you became aware of the police misconduct.**
  
      [INDENTBY 0.6in]If this date passes, you will **no longer have a right to complain.** This website does not, and cannot, provide advice on the timeline to make a complaint in your specific case.
      
  ###Everyone has the right to request their personal information from the police
  
  [INDENTBY 0.6in]**Everyone has the right to request their personal information from the police**, thanks to the *Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act*. Sometimes requesting police records can reveal more information about an incident. **To learn more about requesting your police records, [click here](https://www.calgary.ca/cps/public-services/freedom-of-information-and-protection-of-privacy-act-request.html).**
  
  ###If you have been charged with criminal offences during the incident you want to complain about, this information could affect your defence of the criminal charges.
  
  [INDENTBY 0.6in]If the incident you want to complain about **resulted in you being charged with criminal offences**, and those criminal charges have not been resolved, you **may want to speak to a lawyer before making a complaint** through this service or otherwise, as **information you provide during the complaint process may affect your defence of the criminal charges.**
  
  ###If after reading the above, you would like to use this service to complain, please press **Continue** below to proceed to the next screen where you will find a few important notes before beginning to answer any questions. 
  
  [INDENTBY 0.6in]Should you choose to proceed with this service, it is your sole responsibility to ensure all information is true and accurate, and that you are aware of all legal issues and/or consequences that could arise as a result of your using this service. By using this service, you agree the service is not liable for any consequence, legal or otherwise, that may arise from your use of the service.


terms:
  click here: |
    **This service provides legal information, not legal advice.** Legal information is not the same as legal advice. Legal information on this service is **limited to information about the complaint process, generally, and what acts, generally, may or may not constitute misconduct.**
    
    **Legal advice can only be provided by a lawyer**, and is specific to your circumstances. A lawyer can provide legal advice by reviewing the specific circumstances of your case, and applying it to the law, for the purposes of giving opinions and making recommendations about your specific case.
    
    Legal information is general information about legal processes. Unlike legal advice, **legal information is not specific to any person’s particular circumstances and cannot be relied on as a legal opinion or recommendation.**
    
    To assist in understanding the difference between legal information and legal advice, the following **two examples may help.**
    
    *  **Example 1** - this service provides legal information about the time limit to make a complaint under the *Police Act*, but does not provide legal advice about whether your complaint is within that time limit.
    
    *  **Example 2** - this service provides legal information about what types of misconduct can be complained about under the *Police Act*, but does not provide legal advice about what types of misconduct apply to your specific case.
    
    While a lawyer is not necessary to use this service or to make a complaint, **you may find it beneficial to speak to a lawyer before submitting a complaint.** Whether you choose to speak to a lawyer is **entirely your decision** and this service makes no recommendation about that.
    
    **The purpose of this service is to facilitate an individual’s right to complain about police misconduct and increase access to justice.** This service is **not intended to provide an individual with legal representation, or provide legal advice.**
    
    **None of the information submitted by you through this service is reviewed by lawyers.** The information you provide is only reviewed after you submit your final complaint, and the review is not done by lawyers and is done solely for the purpose of investigating your complaints or determining if your complaints should be investigated.

# ==================== Qualified Complainant =================== #
question: |
  You may have grounds for a police misconduct complaint based on what you have told us

subquestion: |
  Based on the information you provided, there might have been police misconduct as
  defined by the Alberta Police Act and Police Service Regulations. 

  If you would like to generate a formal complaint letter, you may do so either anonymously or with your full name and contact information. Investigators need your contact information to follow up with you on the progress of the investigation.
  
  **Warning:** If you choose to remain anonymous, the likely result is your complaint will not be investigated. That is because a precondition of a complaint under s. 42.1(4)(a) of the Police Act is that the person making the complaint provide their full name. If your full name is not provided, your complaint may not be investigated. If you refuse to be contacted, investigators will be unable to contact you and conduct a proper investigation, which may lead to the complaint being considered “abandoned”.

event: last_page
question: |
  You are done!
subquestion: |
  Your letter has been sent to the Calgary Police, Chief of Calgary Police, the Calgary Police Commission, and the Minister of Justice. 
  
  __<h4>What Happens Next</h4>__
  If the complaint leads to an investigation, once the investigation is completed, the Chief of the Calgary Police Service will determine whether or not there is sufficient evidence, based on a balance of probabilities, to prove misconduct. 
  
  If misconduct is proven, the Chief directs what form of discipline, if any, is to take place. This discipline may range from a warning to full dismissal without pay.
  
  __<h4>Appealing Resolution of a Complaint</h4>__
  If dissatisfied with the Chief of Police or the Commission’s resolution of a complaint, an individual also has the right to appeal that decision to the Law Enforcement and Review Board. This Board is an independent non-police body consisting of a chairperson and two members appointed by the provincial government. 
  
  This appeal can relate to the final disposition of a complaint following a formal investigation or hearing, or a summary dismissal of a complaint. To appeal a decision, an individual has to file with a written notice explaining the grounds of your appeal within 30 days of being advised of the decision. 
  
  The Review Board will advise, in writing, of the date, time and place of the hearing and what, if anything, will be required. An individual appealing a decision also has the right to counsel if chosen.
