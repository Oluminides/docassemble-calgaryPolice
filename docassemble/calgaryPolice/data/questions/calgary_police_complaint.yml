    **This online tool provides legal information, not legal advice.** Legal information is not the same as legal advice. Legal information on this service is **limited to information about the complaint process, generally, and what acts, generally, may or may not constitute misconduct.**
    
    **Legal advice can only be provided by a lawyer**, and is specific to your circumstances. A lawyer can provide legal advice by reviewing the specific circumstances of your case, and applying it to the law, for the purposes of giving opinions and making recommendations about your specific case.
    
    Legal information is general information about legal processes. Unlike legal advice, **legal information is not specific to any person’s particular circumstances and cannot be relied on as a legal opinion or recommendation.**
    
    To help in understanding the difference between legal information and legal advice, the following **two examples may help.**
    
    *  **Example 1** - Our online tool provides legal information about the time limit to make a complaint under the *Police Act*, but does not provide legal advice about whether your complaint is within that time limit.
    
    *  **Example 2** - Our online tool provides legal information about what types of misconduct can be complained about under the *Police Act*, but does not provide legal advice about what types of misconduct apply to your specific case.
    
    While a lawyer is not necessary to use this service or to make a complaint, **you might find it helpful to speak to a lawyer before submitting a complaint.** Speaking to a lawyer is **entirely your decision** and this online tool makes no recommendation about that.
    
    **The purpose of this service is to help an individual’s right to complain about police misconduct and increase access to justice.** This service is **not intended to provide an individual with legal representation, or provide legal advice.**
    
    **None of the information submitted by you through this service is reviewed by lawyers.** The information you provide is only reviewed after you submit your final complaint, and the review is not done by lawyers and is done solely for the purpose of investigating your complaints or determining if your complaints should be investigated.
      
  More info<span style="color:white">2</span>: |
    <li>The primary goal of a police complaint is accountability. <strong>There is no financial compensation available through the complaint process.</strong>
  
  More info<span style="color:#F2F2F2">3</span>: |
    <li>A complaint must be made within <strong>1 year of the date of the police misconduct</strong>, or within <strong>1 year you became aware of the police misconduct.</strong> <br/><br/> If this date has passed, you will <strong>no longer have a right to complain.</strong> This website does not, and cannot, give you advice on the timeline to make a complaint in your specific case.
  
  More info<span style="color:#F2F2F2">4</span>: |
    <li><strong>Everyone has the right to request their personal information from the police,</strong> thanks to the <i>Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act.</i> <br/><br/>Sometimes requesting police records <strong>can uncover more information</strong> about an incident. <strong>To learn more about requesting your police records, <a href="https://www.calgary.ca/cps/public-services/freedom-of-information-and-protection-of-privacy-act-request.html">click here</a>

  
  More info<span style="color:white">5</span>: |
    <li>If the incident you want to complain about <strong>resulted in you being charged with criminal offences,</strong> and those criminal charges have not been resolved, you <strong>might want to speak to a lawyer before making a complaint</strong> because the <strong>information you give police during the complaint process can be used against you in court and may affect your defence of the criminal charges.</strong>

  <h3><strong><span style="color:#2fbd39">Your complaint might potentially be police misconduct.</span></strong></h3>
  ###
  
  This online tool detected **${ plainNum }** potential reasons your complaint might be police misconduct.

  If you want to have the app write you a professional complaint letter, you can choose if you want to use your name and contact information, or stay anonymous.
  
  [INDENTBY 0.6in]**Warning:** If you choose to remain anonymous, the likely result is your complaint will not be investigated. That is because a precondition of a complaint under s. 42.1(4)(a) of the *Police Act* is that the person making the complaint provide their full name. If your full name is not provided, your complaint may not be investigated. If you refuse to be contacted, investigators will be unable to contact you and conduct a proper investigation, which may lead to the complaint being considered “abandoned”.

  __<h4>What Happens Next</h4>__
  If the complaint leads to an investigation, once the investigation is completed, the Chief of the Calgary Police Service will determine whether or not there is enough evidence to prove misconduct. 
  
  If misconduct is proven, the Chief directs the form of discipline, if any. This discipline can range from a warning to full dismissal without pay.
  
  __<h4>Appealing Resolution of a Complaint</h4>__
  If you are not happy with how the Chief of Police or the Commission’s resolves your complaint, you have the right to appeal their decision to the Law Enforcement and Review Board. This Board is an independent non-police body consisting of a chairperson and two members appointed by the provincial government. 
  
  This appeal can relate to the final disposition of a complaint after a formal investigation or hearing, or a summary dismissal of a complaint. To appeal a decision, you have to file a written notice explaining why you are appealing, within 30 days of being told of the decision.  
  
  The Review Board will let you know in writing if anything more is required. If you appeal a decision you also have the right to a lawyer if you want.
